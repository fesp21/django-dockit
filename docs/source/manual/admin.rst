Admin
=====

.. module:: dockit.admin


Django admin integration is no longer actively supported, please use django-hyperadmin if possible. It is the belief of the maintainers that the Django Admin poorly supports documents and that an alternative is better in the long run. If you must use the Django Admin with dockit and come accross an issue then patches will be accepted.

Dockit provides some basic admin functionality for documents. Additionally the admin allows for editing of nested schemas in your document and also allows for customization on a per schema basis.
